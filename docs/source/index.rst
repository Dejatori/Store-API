Store API Documentation
=======================

Welcome to the Store API documentation.

This documentation provides an overview of the Store API, its modules, and how to use it effectively.
It is designed to help developers understand the structure and functionality of the API, as well as provide guidance on how to extend and customize it for their own needs.
The Store API is a RESTful API built with FastAPI, designed to manage and serve data for a store application.
It provides endpoints for user authentication, data management, and background tasks, among other features.

The API is built using Python and FastAPI, and it is designed to be easy to use and extend.
The API is structured into several modules, each responsible for a specific aspect of the application.
The modules are organized to provide a clear separation of concerns, making it easier to maintain and extend the codebase.
